# Outcomes

**Increased privacy**

The extra layer of encryption provided by Cloak enhanced user privacy by preventing unauthorized access to communications. This made it harder for cybercriminals, hackers, and government agencies to access sensitive information. It also nullifies encryption backdoors introduced by messaging apps, as the message is encrypted before the app even touches it.

**Secure communication**

The use of strong encryption algorithms such as ECDH and AES ensured that communications exchanged through Cloak are secure and cannot be intercepted or tampered with during transmission.

**Lightweight encryption**

Cloak makes full use of the existing web security technologies surrounding it, like HTTPS, and doesn't redundantly provide security HTTPS and other technologies already provide. Cloak only implements whatever is _exactly_ required which will, along with its surrounding technologies, deliver the promise of End to End Encryption. Thus, Cloak light as a feather and easily accessible for everyone.

**Increased adoption of encryption**

The ease of use and effectiveness of Cloak encouraged more people to adopt encryption for their communications, thus increasing the overall level of privacy and security on the internet. It also encouraged more developers to integrate encryption into their apps and services, thus making it easier for users to encrypt their communications.

**Societal Impact**

In the age of digital surveillance, a product like Cloak goes a long way in allowing the average user to easily increase their digital security. The best place to start is communication, and Cloak fits this hand like a glove.
